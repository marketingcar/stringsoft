A wide area network (WAN) connects these various technologies, and they are integrated to create an orchestrated, logical entity that channels workloads between private infrastructure and public clouds as needed. Keep reading to learn how your practice can benefit from a hybrid cloud environment.</p>
<h3>#1: Hybrid clouds are more cost efficient</h3>
<p>A hybrid cloud is an excellent option for practices that need security and control over their data but also need a cost-effective way to scale their enterprise when changes in demand occur. A hybrid cloud allows you to store core, business-critical, and sensitive data on your private, on-premises servers while off-loading less sensitive data and applications to the public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow you to pay only for the public cloud resources you use, and when demand spikes, you don’t have to make huge expenditures to expand your infrastructure. You can simply increase your public cloud space. If the demand level drops, you can adjust as needed.</p>
<h3>#2: Hybrid clouds offer flexibility and scalability</h3>
<p>A hybrid cloud environment offers greater control over your practice’s data. As your business needs evolve and the demand for information technology services fluctuates, you can scale your workloads accordingly. You also can adjust your cloud settings to respond automatically to changes in demand to optimize performance and efficiency. You can configure applications that normally run on your private cloud or on-premises to burst into the public cloud when demand increases. Cloud bursting provides additional computing resources when needed so that you can have the necessary capacity and ensure your clients are satisfied.</p>
<h3>#3: Hybrid clouds provide increased security</h3>
<p>Security is extremely important for veterinarians. A main security concern in the public cloud is that the infrastructure is exclusively owned by the cloud provider. The user has no access or control over the infrastructure. In addition, the cloud provider has responsibilities to secure the user’s environments in the cloud, but is rarely responsible if a breach or other malicious activity occurs. The best way to protect your information is to keep your sensitive data and critical workloads on your private infrastructure. Hybrid clouds also allow you to standardize redundant cloud storage, which is an important aspect of data insurance. The centralized management allows you to easily implement strong technical security measures such as encryption, automation, access control, orchestration, and endpoint security so you can manage risk effectively.</p>
<h3>#4: Hybrid clouds improve business continuity</h3>
<p>If a technology failure or disaster occurs, having a hybrid cloud reduces potential downtime and resulting costs. The hybrid model helps you back up your key data by replicating business-critical information to the cloud. In addition, when computing demands increase, you won’t overburden your private servers, which could potentially slow services, because the cloud will scale to absorb the demand.</p>
<h3>#5: Hybrid clouds shift capital expenditures to operational expenditures</h3>
<p>Adopting a hybrid cloud can create tax advantages for your practice. The tax code designates server purchases for a data center as a capital expenditure. This means the servers are codified as a business asset and they must be depreciated on a yearly basis until they are no longer in use. If you purchase a server for $5,000 that is expected to last five years, you would have to depreciate the asset by $1,000 per year for five years to claim the full tax benefit. However, purchasing cloud services is considered an operating expenditure, and they are not subject to depreciation. This means you can claim the full amount as an income reduction in the same year that you purchased the service. If you purchase $5,000 in public cloud services, you can claim the entire tax benefit in the same year, reducing your tax liability.</p>
<h3>#6: Hybrid clouds provide access to cutting-edge technology</h3>
<p>Using a hybrid cloud allows you the flexibility to research technologies that best support your application workload. This gives you access to computing resources that offer high performance and reliable service at the lowest cost.</p>
<h3>#7: Hybrid clouds provide better support for remote workers</h3>

A hybrid cloud environment allows employees with permission to access data from anywhere at any time. This is important for attracting top talent and optimizing productivity and efficiency in your practice.</p>
