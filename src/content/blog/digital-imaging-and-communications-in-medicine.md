DICOM has become indispensable in the veterinary industry, and the system offers numerous advantages. Keep reading to learn about this complex system and how your practice can benefit.</p>
<h3>DICOM history</h3>
<p>In the 1980s, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) made it clear that computing would play an increasingly important role in the medical industry. At the time, the manufacturers of these technologies were the only ones who could easily decode and print the images produced. DICOM history highlights include:</p>
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left: 0px;"></p>
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>1983 </strong>— The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) form a standards committee to address the problem facing radiologists, physicians, and equipment vendors.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>1985 </strong>— ACR-NEMA 300 is released, specifying image transmission and covering point-to-point image communication.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>1993</strong> — The third version of the standard is released. This version uses local area networks by layering the medical image protocols on top of general networking protocols. The name is changed to DICOM.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>1995</strong> — The DICOM standards committee is reorganized to formally represent all medical specialties using imaging.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>2000</strong> — Internet security mechanisms are added through secure communication profiles for the DICOM protocol.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Early 2000s</strong> — Digital radiography becomes mainstream for veterinarians.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>2003</strong> — Multi-frame enhanced image formats are adopted to support the next generation of advanced imaging technologies.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>2006</strong> — The DICOM standards committee releases a supplementary addendum to address the special needs in veterinary medicine and veterinary diagnostic imaging.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>2016</strong> — Small animal acquisition context is added.</li>
</ul>
<p></div>
<h3>DICOM applications</h3>
<p>DICOM is the standard communications protocol for capturing, storing, and transferring medical images and related data. The term refers to the protocol, as well as the corresponding file format. Specific applications include:</p>
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left: 0px;"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Data format</strong> — DICOM organizes information into data sets so that an image contains the patient identification in the file, preventing the image from being separated from this information by mistake.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Image display</strong> — The DICOM committee developed a grayscale standard display function. This was necessary to ensure grayscale image displays were identical on different monitors and hard copy images were consistent when printed from various printers.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Modality worklist</strong> — The DICOM modality worklist service describes imaging procedures that have been scheduled for operation by an image acquisition device. The items on the work list include details about the patient (e.g., name, sex, age), the procedure scheduled, equipment type, the reason for the exam, and the veterinarian ordering the exam. This information is used by the imaging device to populate details in the image metadata. Before this technology, the scanner operator had to enter the information manually.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Storage</strong> — The DICOM store service allows users to send images to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) or workstation. The DICOM storage commitment service allows users to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device. This may be on a redundant disk or on backup media.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Retrieve</strong> — DICOM users can use a workstation to find image lists and retrieve them from a PAC.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #189AA6;"></i> <strong>Print</strong> — The DICOM print service is used to send images to a DICOM printer and ensures consistency among various display devices, including hard copy printouts.</li>
</ul>

Benefits for veterinarians include:</p>
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left: 0px;"></p>
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #148E9E;"></i> <strong>Better diagnosis and patient care</strong> — When veterinarians have the ability to send medical data and ask for advice from a consulting veterinary expert, they can provide more accurate diagnoses and better patient care.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #148E9E;"></i> <strong>Improved workflow</strong> — DICOM eliminates the need to struggle with manual filing. Veterinarians can quickly retrieve and access images remotely, saving time and energy.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #148E9E;"></i> <strong>Easier access</strong> — DICOM provides a more organized and convenient management system for patient information. All data can be accessed through a single workstation since images are integrated into the hospital’s database.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #148E9E;"></i> <strong>Improved communication</strong> — DICOM allows images and structured reports to easily be sent to referring veterinarians, improving communication so everyone knows the patient’s condition.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color: #148E9E;"></i> <strong>No need for physical storage</strong> — Images are securely stored digitally, eliminating the need for bulky physical storage files.</li>
</ul>
