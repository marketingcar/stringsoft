As staffing shortages plague the veterinary industry, your team has no time to waste on inefficient workflows. Ensure your veterinary practice team's focus remains on clients and their pets by relying on well-designed practice management software that can automate many time-eating—but necessary—tasks. To learn how you and your team can complete each workday's necessary—but mundane—administrative tasks, read our **StringSoft** software team's practice management software guide, and boost your veterinary practice's efficiency.

#### 1. Automate and Link Veterinary Practice Administrative Tasks

When you entered the veterinary field, you likely expected to spend most of your day caring for patients rather than staring at a computer screen. Fortunately, current practice management software has streamlined and automated many veterinary practice administrative tasks such as entering medical record information, generating invoices, and searching for laboratory results. Ideally, your software should be your practice's workhorse, automating many mundane tasks that bog down your team. Through a single click, innovative technology can attach treatments and charges to SOAP entries, create automatic client callbacks, and generate reminders. This automated linking saves your team time, and offers improved patient and client care by ensuring no information falls through the cracks.

#### 2. Allow Clients to Access Their Own Pet-Care Requests

If your practice management software does not provide a client portal, your veterinary practice—and your clients—are missing out. Millennials likely comprise a growing portion of your client demographic, and they expect to play a major role in their pet's care, using technology to do so. Making their pets' medical information easily accessible will strengthen your bond, and increase your millennial clients' loyalty, while taking a huge load off your team's plate. Through a client portal, pet owners can:

- View past and upcoming appointments
- Schedule visits
- View vaccination and health service reminders
- Request prescription refills
- Pay outstanding invoices
- Electronically sign treatment plans and make a deposit toward services
- Communicate with a veterinary team member

After your veterinary practice introduces a client portal, your team will see a reduction in phone calls. As you and your team direct an increasing number of clients to the portal, and they begin to understand the technology's numerous benefits, your clients will complete many of the time-consuming administrative tasks your team currently manages.

#### 3. Create Protocols in Your Veterinary Practice Management Software

An efficient team anticipates each other's needs—making necessary supplies available, delivering treatment plans, and obtaining client permission—all before the veterinarian completes their exam room consultation. When effective practice protocols are in place, veterinarians no longer have to spend lengthy periods dictating to the support team about each patient's test, treatment, and medication. To ensure your team's maximum efficiency and consistency, provide staff with written medical protocol guidelines for commonly performed procedures. After creating common protocol templates, categorize line items in your practice management software to ensure all related services, medications, and supplies are always included. These groupings that automatically populate from your medical record notes or treatment plan templates will improve fee capture, and minimize human error when you and your team are strapped for time.

#### 4. Integrate With Outside Veterinary Applications

Your time is best spent caring for patients and communicating with clients. So, stop wasting this precious resource by chasing down laboratory reports and diagnostic images, and ensure your practice management software integrates with your diagnostic tools. Laboratory results and images should automatically load to each patient's medical record, allowing you to review every aspect of a pet's health history at once. In addition, your practice management software should integrate with outside applications such as those which provide telemedicine services. Clients appreciate the ability to communicate with their veterinarians without having to drive to the practice, and telemedicine capability enables you to care for more patients in less time.

#### 5. Automate Veterinary Data Backup and Software Updates

If your team's end-of-day tasks include backing up data and waiting around for a software update, you are wasting their time and your money. Current practice management software automates these critical tasks—with no effort on your team's part and no veterinary practice downtime. Current veterinary practice management software automates many mundane administrative processes, enabling your team to perform tasks only they are trained to complete. By upgrading your software, you give your team the opportunity to focus on the work they value—patient and client care.
