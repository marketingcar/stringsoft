You need your interaction to be quick and efficient and to provide the information you need in an understandable and concise manner. StringSoft strives to respond promptly to customers and offers several service options to ensure they receive the best solution possible in the shortest amount of time. Keep reading to learn how StringSoft addresses common customer service-related pain points to ensure you can get back to your busy day quickly.\n\n## Help Desk Tickets\n\nOne of the most common customer service-related frustrations occurs when you can’t reach an agent by your preferred method. StringSoft allows you to start a help ticket by email, phone call, live chat, community post, or through your portal. Once created, the ticket is routed to a specific group or an individual agent, depending on variables such as specialization and language, to ensure the problem is handled by the appropriate person. Potential ticket requests include:\n\n- **Technical support** — Users can request support immediately for questions and problems they experience. Also, if you are busy but don’t want to forget the problem, you can submit a support request, and the agent will review the issue and contact you at a convenient time to resolve the problem.\n- **Features** — If you feel your practice can benefit from a particular feature, you can send in a feature request from StringSoft’s user menu. The feature requests are monitored by customer support, and an agent will contact you if they have additional questions before sending the request to development for review.\n- **Training** — Users can request one-on-one or group training to ensure their team understands how to operate the StringSoft system. You can receive step-by-step instructions or view training videos for any aspect of the system, including configuration and frequently asked questions.\n\n## Live Chat\n\nDelayed response is another common customer service-related pain point. If you need help right away, live chat allows you to communicate instantly with an agent. This provides a quick and efficient way to address problems, and prevents tedious phone calls. Many users find this option more convenient and practical than phone or email.\n\n## Knowledge Base\n\nEvery person seeking customer support wants access to accurate and useful product knowledge. Knowledge base is an article repository where users can find answers to commonly asked questions without creating a ticket or communicating with an agent. Benefits include:\n\n- **Instant access** — Knowledge base articles provide instant access to solutions, and the information is available around the clock so you can obtain answers when an agent isn’t on duty.\n- **Relevant information** — Articles are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure the information is useful and relevant.\n- **Easy searchability** — Knowledge base articles are fully indexed, so you can find the answers you need easily.\n\n## Community\n\nUsers may be frustrated if they feel their problem isn’t properly understood and acknowledged. StringSoft’s community feature allows you to communicate with other users and with company representatives. This option allows you to ask and answer questions online to help solve issues, and is available around the clock. When a successful and popular response is submitted, the information remains available forever or until someone provides a better response. The community feature also allows you to see the progress on an issue and the status of a feature request\n\n## Portal\n![A woman typing on a laptop with a technical support button](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Portal.jpg)\nUsers don’t want to deal with multiple interfaces to get the help they need in the way they need it. The portal is the main entry point where users can create tickets, start live chats, read knowledge base information, interact with the community, and track progress on issues they’ve submitted. The portal consolidates technical support options in one interface to make finding answers easy and convenient. As a veterinarian, your top priority is your patients and your clients, and you don’t want a technical issue to prevent you from providing the best possible care. StringSoft provides exceptional customer service features to address many common customer service-related pain points to ensure you receive the answers you need in a convenient and timely manner. Our useful features help ensure you can spend your valuable time addressing your patient’s needs instead of waiting on hold to speak to a technical support agent. Contact **StringSoft** today to find out more about these helpful features.\n',filename:"addressing-customer-service-related-pain-points"},{content:'---\ntitle: "Benefits of Veterinary Practice Management Software Referral and Client Portals"\nslug: "benefits-of-veterinary-practice-management-software-referral-and-client-portals"\nexcerpt: "Veterinary referral partnerships are crucial for providing advanced patient care, and these relationships require that the necessary information flows easily in both directions.

When a general practitioner refers a pet patient to your specialty practice, an open line of communication is key to ensure the pet gets the care they need. In addition, the pet owner must be continuously informed so they are aware of their pet’s status and know how to properly care for their pet after discharge. StringSoft understands the critical need for excellent client communication, and our practice management software includes easy-to-use referral and client portals to facilitate referral management.\n\n### Veterinary referral portal\nVeterinarians refer their patients for many reasons, and an accessible veterinary practice management software (PMS) referral portal makes this process easy and convenient for the referring and the receiving veterinarians. This feature facilitates many tasks, including:\n\n- **Making a referral** — The referring veterinarian can use the portal to submit cases electronically.\n- **Submitting records** — The referring veterinarian can use the portal to submit client and patient information, including client contact details, patient history, clinical signs, lab results, and diagnostic images, and to specify the documentation sequence. Once the client makes an appointment, this information is automatically attached to the patient’s medical record.\n- **Reviewing the case** — The receiving veterinarian can view the submitted case information prior to the patient’s appointment and request additional information or documents, if needed.\n- **Providing an estimate** — The receiving veterinarian can use the portal to provide the estimated costs for the referral procedure, which allows the referring veterinarian to inform the pet owner, so he or she is not surprised when they receive the attending veterinarian’s bill.\n- **Updating the record** — The receiving veterinarian can easily update the patient’s record as their case progresses.\n- **Receiving updates** — The referring veterinarian can view case details from the web portal, and the veterinary specialist can decide which information is accessible to each referring veterinarian.\n- **Maintaining communication** — The referring veterinarian can ask questions or convey additional information through the website, and the receiving veterinarian can send messages and updates.\n- **Viewing cases** — The referring veterinarian can view all of their referred cases on a single screen, and easily receive status updates for each case.\n- **Downloading cases** — The referring veterinarian can use the portal to download a patient’s entire record as a single pdf file.\n- **Viewing referrals** — The receiving veterinarian can view all communications from a referring veterinarian on a single screen, and can respond from the portal.\n- **Reporting on referrals** — The portal helps track referring cases, including year-to-date cases, monetary values, and who is sending referrals.\n- **Managing multiple referrals** — For patients needing several specialty services, the portal keeps their medical information and documents in one convenient place.\n- **Personalizing the site** — The website belongs only to the referral practice and can reflect their practice’s image.\n\n### Veterinary client portal\n![a woman sitting on a bed with a cat and a laptop](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Veterinary-client-portal.jpg)Good communication with pet owners provides better clinical outcomes, improves client satisfaction, and increases client compliance in response to veterinary recommendations. An easily accessible veterinary PMS client portal helps facilitate veterinary team-pet owner communication, to ensure the pet owner can perform the necessary tasks. Benefits for pet owners include:\n\n- **Viewing appointments** — Pet owners can log in to their account through the client portal and view their pet’s upcoming appointments.\n- **Requesting appointments** — Pet owners can request appointments through the portal, instead of making multiple phone calls or playing phone tag with a busy CSR.\n- **Refilling prescriptions** — Pet owners can request prescription refills through the portal, and conveniently receive their pet’s medications.\n- **Viewing invoices and estimates** — Pet owners can use the portal to view past invoices and estimates for upcoming procedures.\n- **Making payments** — Pet owners can conveniently make payments through the portal.\n- **Messaging** — Pet owners can ask questions and provide updates on their pet, and veterinary team members can respond through the portal. General practices and referral hospitals are extremely busy, and communicating clearly and efficiently is necessary to ensure everyone remains informed and the patient is cared for appropriately. Exceptional pet owner communication can also help ensure clients are satisfied and understand the information that is relayed. Veterinary PMS referral and client portals greatly facilitate referral management and client communication and will improve your team’s ability to provide optimal patient care. If you would like to learn how excellent communication can benefit your practice, and more ways our veterinary software can help, contact **StringSoft**, and help your practice thrive.\n',filename:"benefits-of-veterinary-practice-management-software-referral-and-client-portals"},{content:'---\ntitle: "The Benefits of Applying Stable Workflows and Processes to Your Veterinary Practice"\nslug: "the-benefits-of-applying-stable-workflows-and-processes-to-your-veterinary-practice"\nexcerpt: "Running a successful veterinary practice goes beyond providing excellent care to pets—it requires streamlined operations, efficient management, and consistent service delivery.

Implementing stable workflows and processes can significantly enhance your practice\'s productivity, client satisfaction, and overall success. Here are the key benefits of applying stable workflows and processes to your veterinary practice.\n\n#### 1. **Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity**\n\nStable workflows streamline daily operations, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks and minimizing the chances of errors. By clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and procedures, you ensure that every team member knows exactly what to do and when to do it. This leads to faster service delivery, fewer bottlenecks, and more time for veterinarians and staff to focus on patient care.\n\n#### 2. **Consistent Quality of Care**\n\nStandardized processes ensure that every patient receives the same high level of care, regardless of which team member is involved. By following established protocols for examinations, treatments, and follow-ups, you can maintain a consistent standard of care that builds trust with your clients and ensures the best outcomes for their pets.\n\n#### 3. **Improved Client Experience**\n\nClients appreciate consistency and reliability. When your practice operates with stable workflows, clients can expect timely appointments, clear communication, and efficient handling of their pets\' needs. This enhances their overall experience, leading to higher satisfaction, repeat visits, and positive word-of-mouth referrals.\n\n#### 4. **Better Time Management**\n\nEffective workflows help manage time more efficiently. With clear guidelines and schedules, your staff can prioritize tasks, avoid unnecessary delays, and ensure that all critical activities are completed on time. This is particularly important in a busy veterinary practice where timely care can significantly impact patient health.\n\n#### 5. **Reduced Stress for Staff**\n\nStable workflows reduce confusion and uncertainty, creating a more organized and predictable work environment. When everyone knows their roles and what is expected of them, it minimizes workplace stress and enhances job satisfaction. A happier, more focused team is more likely to provide excellent care and customer service.\n\n#### 6. **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration**\n\nWell-defined processes promote clear communication and collaboration among team members. When everyone understands the workflow, it becomes easier to coordinate tasks, share information, and work together to solve problems. This leads to smoother operations and a more cohesive team.\n\n#### 7. **Increased Accountability**\n\nEstablishing workflows and processes creates a framework for accountability. With clearly defined responsibilities and performance metrics, it’s easier to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and hold team members accountable for their tasks. This fosters a culture of responsibility and continuous improvement within your practice.\n\n#### 8. **Scalability and Growth**\n\nStable workflows provide a solid foundation for growth. As your practice expands, having established processes in place makes it easier to onboard new staff, open additional locations, and introduce new services. Consistency in operations ensures that the quality of care and client experience remains high, even as your practice scales.\n\n#### 9. **Regulatory Compliance**\n\nVeterinary practices must adhere to various regulations and standards. Stable workflows help ensure compliance by standardizing procedures and documentation. This reduces the risk of non-compliance and associated penalties, protecting your practice’s reputation and financial health.\n\n#### 10. **Data-Driven Decision Making**\n\nConsistent processes generate reliable data that can be used to make informed decisions. By analyzing workflow data, you can identify trends, measure performance, and pinpoint areas for improvement. This enables you to make strategic decisions that enhance efficiency, improve patient care, and drive business growth.\n\n## Conclusion\nImplementing stable workflows and processes is essential for the success of any veterinary practice. By enhancing efficiency, ensuring consistent quality of care, and improving client satisfaction, standardized processes can transform your operations and support your growth. Investing time in developing and maintaining these workflows will pay off in the form of a more productive, stress-free, and successful practice. Ready to take your veterinary practice to the next level? Start by evaluating your current workflows, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing standardized processes that align with your practice’s goals. The benefits are clear—embrace stable workflows and watch your practice thrive.\n',filename:"the-benefits-of-applying-stable-workflows-and-processes-to-your-veterinary-practice"},{content:'---\ntitle: "The Top Challenges of Managing a Multi-Hospital Veterinary Practice"\nslug: "the-top-challenges-of-managing-a-multi-hospital-veterinary-practice"\nexcerpt: "Managing a multi-hospital veterinary practice can be a rewarding but complex endeavor.

With multiple locations, diverse teams, and varying patient needs, ensuring smooth operations and consistent care across all hospitals is no small feat. Here are the top challenges faced by managers of multi-hospital veterinary practices and some strategies to overcome them.\n\n#### 1. Maintaining Consistency in Care\n\nOne of the most significant challenges is ensuring that all hospitals provide a consistent level of care. Differences in staff experience, facility resources, and local practices can lead to variability in service quality.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nDevelop standardized protocols and procedures for all aspects of care, from patient intake to treatment and follow-up. Regular training sessions and audits can help maintain these standards across all locations.\n\n#### 2. Effective Communication and Coordination\n\nWith multiple locations, ensuring effective communication and coordination between teams can be challenging. Miscommunication can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and a fragmented patient experience.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nImplement a centralized communication system that facilitates real-time information sharing and collaboration. Regular meetings and updates can also help keep everyone on the same page.\n\n#### 3. Resource Allocation and Management\n\nBalancing resources such as staff, equipment, and supplies across multiple hospitals can be difficult. Over- or under-allocation of resources can impact the quality of care and operational efficiency.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nUse data-driven approaches to monitor resource usage and needs at each location. Implement a flexible resource allocation strategy that allows for quick adjustments based on changing demands.\n\n#### 4. Staff Recruitment and Retention\n\nAttracting and retaining skilled veterinary professionals is a common challenge, compounded by the need to staff multiple locations. High turnover rates can disrupt continuity of care and increase operational costs.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nOffer competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a positive work environment to attract and retain top talent. Building a strong organizational culture that values employee contributions can also improve retention.\n\n#### 5. Technology Integration\n\nIntegrating technology systems across multiple hospitals can be complex. Ensuring that all locations use compatible and up-to-date systems is crucial for efficient operations and data management.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nInvest in a comprehensive veterinary practice management software that supports multi-location operations. Regularly update and maintain these systems to ensure they meet the needs of all hospitals.\n\n#### 6. Financial Management\n\nManaging finances across multiple hospitals involves tracking expenses, revenues, and profitability at each location. It can be challenging to maintain financial health while ensuring each hospital operates efficiently.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nImplement robust financial management systems and practices that provide detailed insights into the financial performance of each hospital. Regular financial reviews and audits can help identify areas for cost savings and revenue optimization.\n\n#### 7. Client Experience and Satisfaction\n\nEnsuring a consistent and positive client experience across all locations is vital for patient retention and practice reputation. Variability in service quality and communication can lead to client dissatisfaction.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTrain staff to provide exceptional client service and maintain consistent communication protocols. Collect and analyze client feedback regularly to identify and address areas for improvement.\n\n#### 8. Compliance and Regulation\n\nVeterinary practices must adhere to various local, state, and federal regulations. Ensuring compliance across multiple hospitals can be time-consuming and complex.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nDesignate a compliance officer or team to oversee regulatory adherence at all locations. Implement standardized compliance protocols and conduct regular training and audits to ensure all hospitals meet regulatory requirements.\n\n#### 9. Brand Identity and Marketing\n\nMaintaining a cohesive brand identity while marketing multiple hospitals can be challenging. Each location may have different strengths, specialties, and client bases.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nDevelop a unified brand strategy that highlights the unique strengths of each location while maintaining a consistent overall brand message. Tailored marketing campaigns can help attract and retain clients at each hospital.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nManaging a multi-hospital veterinary practice comes with its unique set of challenges, but with the right strategies and tools, these can be effectively addressed. By focusing on consistency in care, effective communication, resource management, and staff retention, you can ensure that your practice operates smoothly and delivers high-quality care across all locations. Embrace technology, prioritize financial management, and maintain a strong brand identity to drive success and growth in your multi-hospital veterinary practice.',filename:"the-top-challenges-of-managing-a-multi-hospital-veterinary-practice"},{content:'---\ntitle: "7 Benefits of a Hybrid Cloud for Veterinarians"\nslug: "7-benefits-of-a-hybrid-cloud-for-veterinarians"\nexcerpt: "A hybrid cloud incorporates public clouds, a private cloud, and on-premises resources to provide flexibility in data deployment options for busy veterinary practices.

A wide area network (WAN) connects these various technologies, and they are integrated to create an orchestrated, logical entity that channels workloads between private infrastructure and public clouds as needed. Keep reading to learn how your practice can benefit from a hybrid cloud environment.\n\n#### 1. Hybrid Clouds Are More Cost Efficient\nA hybrid cloud is an excellent option for practices that need security and control over their data but also need a cost-effective way to scale their enterprise when changes in demand occur. A hybrid cloud allows you to store core, business-critical, and sensitive data on your private, on-premises servers while off-loading less sensitive data and applications to the public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow you to pay only for the public cloud resources you use, and when demand spikes, you don’t have to make huge expenditures to expand your infrastructure. You can simply increase your public cloud space. If the demand level drops, you can adjust as needed.\n\n#### 2. Hybrid Clouds Offer Flexibility and Scalability\nA hybrid cloud environment offers greater control over your practice’s data. As your business needs evolve and the demand for information technology services fluctuates, you can scale your workloads accordingly. You also can adjust your cloud settings to respond automatically to changes in demand to optimize performance and efficiency. You can configure applications that normally run on your private cloud or on-premises to burst into the public cloud when demand increases. Cloud bursting provides additional computing resources when needed so that you can have the necessary capacity and ensure your clients are satisfied.\n\n#### 3. Hybrid Clouds Provide Increased Security\nSecurity is extremely important for veterinarians. A main security concern in the public cloud is that the infrastructure is exclusively owned by the cloud provider. The user has no access or control over the infrastructure. In addition, the cloud provider has responsibilities to secure the user’s environments in the cloud, but is rarely responsible if a breach or other malicious activity occurs. The best way to protect your information is to keep your sensitive data and critical workloads on your private infrastructure. Hybrid clouds also allow you to standardize redundant cloud storage, which is an important aspect of data insurance. The centralized management allows you to easily implement strong technical security measures such as encryption, automation, access control, orchestration, and endpoint security so you can manage risk effectively.\n\n#### 4. Hybrid Clouds Improve Business Continuity\nIf a technology failure or disaster occurs, having a hybrid cloud reduces potential downtime and resulting costs. The hybrid model helps you back up your key data by replicating business-critical information to the cloud. In addition, when computing demands increase, you won’t overburden your private servers, which could potentially slow services, because the cloud will scale to absorb the demand.\n\n#### 5. Hybrid Clouds Shift Capital Expenditures to Operational Expenditures\nAdopting a hybrid cloud can create tax advantages for your practice. The tax code designates server purchases for a data center as a capital expenditure. This means the servers are codified as a business asset and they must be depreciated on a yearly basis until they are no longer in use. If you purchase a server for $5,000 that is expected to last five years, you would have to depreciate the asset by $1,000 per year for five years to claim the full tax benefit. However, purchasing cloud services is considered an operating expenditure, and they are not subject to depreciation. This means you can claim the full amount as an income reduction in the same year that you purchased the service. If you purchase $5,000 in public cloud services, you can claim the entire tax benefit in the same year, reducing your tax liability.\n\n#### 6. Hybrid Clouds Provide Access to Cutting-Edge Technology\nUsing a hybrid cloud allows you the flexibility to research technologies that best support your application workload. This gives you access to computing resources that offer high performance and reliable service at the lowest cost.\n\n#### 7. Hybrid Clouds Provide Better Support for Remote Workers\n\n![alt](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Hybrid-clouds-provide-better-support-for-remote-workers-1.jpg)\n\nMany veterinarians prefer to write case notes from the comfort of their home, or they may need access to a file during their day off. A hybrid cloud environment allows employees with permission to access data from anywhere at any time. This is important for attracting top talent and optimizing productivity and efficiency in your practice.\nA hybrid cloud offers the best of private and public cloud scenarios. Contact **StringSoft** today for a free demonstration to see how this feature can benefit your practice.\n',filename:"7-benefits-of-a-hybrid-cloud-for-veterinarians"},{content:'---\ntitle: "Is Your Veterinary Practice’s Data Stored Safely?"\nslug: "is-your-veterinary-practices-data-stored-safely"\nexcerpt: "Your local news channel one evening reports on a security breach in your credit card company.

Worried that your sensitive information, such as your social security and credit card account numbers, has been stolen, you quickly call the company and demand to know that your information is secure. But, they cannot make any promises, and you’re left feeling troubled about the inevitable mess after such a data leak. If you’ve ever been in this situation, you know how terrifying it is to hear about a security breach of your personal data. Compound that horror of leaked information by your number of clients, add in your personal business records, and you may suffer from a full-fledged panic attack.\n\n## Storage Options StringSoft Offers for Your Veterinary Practice\'s Data\n\nStringSoft is the only company that offers all four types of storage—cloud-based, premise-based, or hybrid options of each. Most providers offer only one data-storage option, severely limiting your choices. Our veterinary management software program is the only program on the market that runs in a browser or an app, or on a virtual session. If you’re concerned about your data existing outside your practice’s walls, we can set up a premise-based storage option or, if you’re only interested in running on the cloud, we can do that. Whatever your data-storage needs, we can exceed your expectations.\n\n## Features of Storage Options for Your Veterinary Practice\'s Data\n\nAt StringSoft, we do things differently than most software providers. We have spent more than a decade building a revolutionary system for the world’s largest universities and hospitals, and we can now bring you that advanced technology. Privately owned [general practices](https://stringsoft.com/general-practice/) can also enjoy the software solutions we offer, no matter which option interests you.\n**Our cloud storage and hybrid cloud storage have a variety of features:**\n\n- The user owns the data in the pure cloud.\n- Direct access to the data is limited.\n- Most providers stipulate that they own the data, not the customer—at StringSoft, we don’t believe in that. Keep in mind that as your data-storage needs grow, your cost with cloud-based storage will also grow.\n\n**Our premise-based storage and hybrid premise-based storage boast the following benefits:**\n\n- Premise-based storage cost is mostly upfront, with a limited monthly or annual cost.\n- If you already have premise-based equipment, we can update your storage solution to feature a revolutionary premise-based storage option, or create a hybrid option designed specifically to meet your needs.\n\n## Data Ownership and Security\n![a person holding a dog\'s paw in their hand](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Data-ownership-and-security.jpg)\n\nIf your data is stored at the software-provider’s location, you may not own the data—the data is generally owned by the software provider. Your data may be shared with third parties or government agencies upon request, unless your contract with the software provider explicitly states otherwise. Data also may not be accessible in these instances if you want to access the full database, making you dependent on the software provider’s API to access this data. We look at things differently at StringSoft. Your data is yours alone, and we do not share it with anyone. We have also designed several levels of security permissions to restrict user access to clearly defined program areas.\n\n**Some ways we ensure your data is secure at every point include:**\n- **Security groups** — Security settings are applied for a group of people at one time.\n- **Screen security** — Each screen must have explicit permit access for each user in the system to be allowed access.\n- **Screen-field security** — Security permissions can be applied to certain sensitive fields, granting access to individual users.\n- **Permission-level security** — Individual permissions within a screen can be controlled on a per-user or per-group basis.\n- **User-defined security** — You can create your own permissions to access custom reports, or for your own external programs in the system. With our [data fortress](https://stringsoft.com/security/), you can rest assured that your sensitive information is safe within the most secure platform in the industry.\n\n**Feature**\n**\n\nCloud**\n**\n\nPremise**\n**\n\nHybrid Premise**\n**\n\nHybrid Cloud**\n**\n\nConfiguration**\n\nBrowser access to all program aspects\nLocal client access to all program aspects\nLocal client and browser access to all program aspects\nLocal client and browser access to all program aspects **Data\n\nOwnership**\n\nOwned by software provider in most instances\nOwned by user\nOwned by user\nOwned by user **Data\n\nSecurity**\n\nProvided by software provider\nProvided by user\nProvided by user\nProvided by database hosting provider **Data\n\nAccess**\n\nControlled by software provider\nControlled by user\nControlled by user\nControlled by user **Data\n\nSharing**\n\nControlled by software provider\nControlled by user\nControlled by user\nControlled by user **Premise\n\nEquipment Required**\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo **Licensing**\n\nPer user/device\nVaries from per device to unlimited\nSame as premise, with additional monthly fee for each user/workstation accessed by the cloud\nPer user/device **Billing\n\nFrequency**\n\nMonthly\nMonthly or annually\nMonthly\nMonthly **License\n\nOwnership**\n\nSoftware provider\nUser\nUser\nUser\nAre you interested in scheduling a complimentary 15-minute consultation to learn how StringSoft can store your veterinary practice’s data safely and securely?

Many veterinary professionals cite bullying, workplace drama, and a toxic atmosphere as their reason for leaving a practice—or for leaving the profession altogether. Ideally, the practice manager and owner should accept responsibility for setting the example for maintaining a positive, supportive workplace, which the rest of the team then begins to emulate. However, for a happier, more fulfilling career no matter your position, you can take the initiative to create a congenial work environment. Our **StringSoft** software team recommends the following tips to help you connect with your colleagues, and create and maintain a positive workplace environment.\n\n#### 1. Develop Positive Veterinary Practice Communication Skills\n\nClear, effective communication is essential for accomplishing team-oriented tasks, and maintaining nonconfrontational working conditions. When working together to provide patient care or meet a client's needs, team members must be well-versed in clearly and succinctly outlining details and explaining the tasks that must be completed. Misunderstanding can lead to frustration and tension among colleagues, and can disrupt patient care. Current practice management software can help facilitate communication, enabling you to input clear medical records, charges, treatments, and payments in a snap. Each veterinary practice department can add their own patient notes, sharing communication throughout the team. To help improve your communication skills, consider how your colleagues best communicate, learn, and understand. Some team members are visual learners, whereas others must actually perform a task to develop a full understanding. Practice communicating by using various communication skills that cater to team members' different learning styles. In addition, you should consider improving your own active listening skills. By making eye contact, nodding, clarifying details, and asking pertinent questions, you demonstrate to colleagues that you are truly focused on what they are saying. Demonstrating effective communication—both speaking and listening—helps build trust, respect, and respectful professional interactions.\n\n#### 2. Appreciate Each Veterinary Practice Team Member's Role\n\nNo matter the number of team members your practice employs, clearly defining each employee's role increases efficiency while preventing turf wars. On a small team, most members are cross-trained and are responsible for multiple tasks. However, to keep your veterinary practice running effectively and efficiently, you must ensure each team member knows their own specific duties and those of their colleagues. By conducting cross-training and role-playing activities during staff meetings, you help foster the entire team's appreciation for each team member's role and the important tasks they tackle. When the entire team understands each colleague's value to providing top-notch client interaction and patient care, they can celebrate each team member's success, which forges a positive veterinary practice environment. For example, veterinary technicians often express a profound fear of having to work the front desk. Your customer service representatives (CSRs) may be unaware that technicians are intimidated by their administrative technology and recognize that working the front desk is no easy task. Share these outlooks during staff meetings so each team member understands that a colleague may decline a request for assistance or to fill in for a team member because they are unfamiliar with the required tasks and technology. When the group is together, ensure you highlight each team member's value, and encourage everyone to show an appreciation for each colleague's role. You will soon observe deeper respect and more positive interactions among your team's members.\n\n#### 3. Acknowledge Veterinary Practice Team Achievements and Personal Growth\n\nWhile mastering a new skill or reaching a goal is rewarding in and of itself, when your colleagues acknowledge your accomplishments, you feel supported through this relationship-building gesture. As a practice manager or team lead, you should alert the entire group when one of them has placed their first IV catheter, obtained Fear Free certification, or unearthed a time-saving software shortcut. These are accomplishments your entire team should celebrate. By focusing on each team member's positive achievements, you boost employee morale, encourage growth, and improve the workplace culture.\n\n#### 4. Ask for Help From and Return the Favor to Your Veterinary Practice Team Colleagues\n\n![two women in scrubs are holding a dog](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Ask-for-help-from-and-return-the-favor-to-your-veterinary-practice-team-colleagues.jpg)\n\nOftentimes, a team member's feelings can be hurt, and resentment simmers after a colleague does not provide help when requested. However, team members often believe that a colleague should simply have seen that they needed assistance—no questions asked. A cohesive team develops through a desire to work together and to offer—and ask for—assistance when necessary. Include teamwork exercises during staff meetings to encourage team members who are not comfortable asking for help to practice doing so. In addition, explain to shy team members that they should request assistance as soon as they need help rather than waiting until they are struggling and feeling frustrated. When the group is together, perform a roleplay activity, and ask team members to swap roles. This practice can help everyone learn to recognize when a colleague may need assistance with a task. Common veterinary practice stressors can strain colleague interactions. Inefficient workflows, overwhelmed staff, and outdated equipment and software can create veterinary team member frustration and impatience. To lighten your team's stress load, upgrade your practice management software.

Learn how to enhance communication and build lasting relationships."\ncategory: "Practice Growth"\ndate: "2025-08-29"\nimage: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551632811-561732d1e306?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80"\nimageDescription: "A happy pet owner interacting with a veterinarian on a tablet showing their pet\'s health data"\n---\nIn veterinary medicine, the patient can\'t tell you what\'s wrong. This makes clear, consistent, and compassionate communication with the pet owner absolutely critical. Building trust through effective communication not only leads to better health outcomes for the patient but also fosters client loyalty, which is the bedrock of a thriving practice. Here are three ways StringSoft\'s tools can help you elevate your client communication strategy. First, provide unparalleled access and convenience with our Client Portal. In today\'s digital world, clients expect to manage their lives online. Our portal allows them to book appointments, view their pet\'s medical records, see lab results, request prescription refills, and pay invoices—all from their computer or smartphone. This self-service model empowers clients, reduces phone calls to your front desk, and ensures they have access to vital information 24/7. Second, implement two-way messaging. While phone calls are still important, they can be inefficient for both your staff and your clients. Our secure, two-way messaging system allows for quick updates, follow-up questions, and sharing of photos or videos without the back-and-forth of phone tag. It\'s perfect for post-operative check-ins, sending reminders, or answering non-urgent questions. This creates a continuous line of communication that clients love. Third, leverage the power of our Referral Portal to streamline communication with referring veterinarians. When a case is referred, keeping the primary care vet in the loop is crucial for continuity of care. Our portal allows referring vets to submit cases electronically, track their progress, and securely access shared labs, images, and treatment updates. This professional courtesy strengthens your relationships within the veterinary community and ensures the best possible outcome for the patient. Ultimately, great communication is about making your clients feel seen, heard, and valued. By leveraging technology to make communication more accessible, convenient, and transparent, you build the trust that turns a one-time visitor into a lifelong client.\n',filename:"improving-client-communication"},{content:"---\ntitle: \"5 Tips for Building Lasting Relationships With Your Veterinary Clients\"\nslug: \"5-tips-for-building-lasting-relationships-with-your-veterinary-clients\"\nexcerpt: \"As you become familiar with their pets, lifestyle, and preferred veterinary care level, a long-term client can be a gift–similar to a lifelong friend.

When you build a strong client relationship–growing in trust and respect–your practice's profitability increases, as does your opportunity to provide better patient care through accepted recommendations. To begin developing long-lasting bonds with your clients, follow our **StringSoft** team's tips.\n\n#### 1. Show Your Human Side\n\nAlthough your clients are likely unaware of the academic rigor required to become a veterinarian, they want their pets' caregivers to be people with whom they can connect. So, let your human side shine through by sharing anecdotes about your own pets and family, making eye contact, showing emotion, and offering hugs, handshakes, and condolences when the situations arise. Being approachable and exhibiting a pleasant bedside manner help you cement your bond with clients, and ensure they continue entrusting their pet's care to your kind, caring veterinary team.\n\n#### 2. Manage Your Schedule Effectively\n\nClients become fed up with your veterinary practice if they have to wait days for their pet's appointment, only to wait hours if your team is running behind that day. Take a hard look at your clients' wait time–from the moment they enter the lobby, to the time they check out. Consider these common workflow inefficiencies:\n\n**Ringing phone lines** — If your customer service representatives (CSRs) are always on the phone, they cannot help the clients at the front desk. Consider outsourcing your phone calls to a veterinary answering service, encouraging clients to perform as many tasks as possible through an app or client portal, or hiring a team member whose sole responsibility is answering the phone.\n\n**Overbooked appointment schedule** — If you have booked three not doing rights (ADRs) during one appointment slot, and your next client has to wait two hours before their pet has their routine wellness appointment, you have one disgruntled pet owner on your hands. Although you feel a responsibility to provide immediate care to sick pets, do not overbook your schedule. Block out ample time for same-day illness appointments, and schedule a limited number of daily wellness visits. To help maximize your caseload and prevent clients' frustration, offer drop-off and telemedicine appointments.\n\n**Slow payment processing** — Invoice generation and payment processing can be time-consuming. However, through innovative practice management software you can speed up the task. Charges can be automatically populated as you fill out medical records, and clients can pay their invoice through a client portal or app.\n\n#### 3. Cater to Your Veterinary Clients' Needs\n\nTo forge a strong bond with your clients, take the time to listen to their needs and concerns, and to answer their questions fully. Help your clients feel valued by using open body language, making eye contact, and sitting down to chat. Truly listen to your clients, because they oftentimes suggest great ideas on how to improve your patient care and client service. Discuss clients' recommendations with your team members, who may know just how to put those ideas in practice.\n\n#### 4. Make Pet Care More Accessible\n\nIn today's world, everyone's to-do list is overloaded. Included in your clients' responsibilities are their pets' vaccinations, exams, prescription refills, and other essential veterinary care, and they often forget to schedule or call until business hours have ended. Help your clients request their pet's veterinary services on their own time by offering them access to a client portal through which they can:\n\n- View vaccination history and reminders\n- Request prescription refills\n- View and request appointments\n- Review cost estimates and invoices\n- Submit payments\n- Message the veterinary team\n\nBy using a client portal, your clients can quickly and easily complete their pet-care administrative tasks. When your veterinary practice makes administrative pet-care tasks as easy as possible, your clients will continue to return because your team offers the convenience of upgraded technology.\n\n#### 5. Skim Each Patient's Medical Record Before Their Veterinary Appointment\n\n![a woman in a white lab coat sitting in front of a laptop computer](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Skim-each-patients-medical-record-before-their-veterinary-appointment.jpg)\n\nBefore an appointment with a patient who has a complicated history, ensure you review their medical record. Taking the time to refresh your memory regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatments—successful and ineffective—goes a long way toward demonstrating how important your client and their pet are to you. This step is essential when you have been a pet's primary veterinarian, because, in your client's eyes, their pet is your most important patient, and they expect you to be well-versed in their beloved companion's medical history. Quickly scanning a patient's complex chart can be a real challenge when using some practice information management systems (PIMS). Therefore, upgrading your software to a more intuitive, easy-to-search program can greatly improve your efficiency and client care.

From enhancing diagnostic accuracy to streamlining administrative tasks, AI is empowering veterinarians to provide better care more efficiently. StringSoft is at the forefront of this revolution, integrating next-generation AI features directly into our practice management system.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of AI is in the realm of diagnostics. Our Clinical Alerts system uses machine learning algorithms to identify potential red flags, such as medication conflicts or unusual test values, that might otherwise be missed. This proactive approach to patient safety can be life-saving.\n\nAI also excels at processing and summarizing vast amounts of data. With StringSoft\'s Smart Summaries, you can generate a concise summary of a patient\'s entire history, a specific visit, or a multi-day case in seconds. This is invaluable for case reviews, client communication, and referrals. Furthermore, our natural language search allows you to \'ask\' your system questions like, \'Show me all diabetic felines treated with insulin in the last year,\' and get instant, accurate answers.\n\nBeyond clinical applications, AI is a massive time-saver. Our voice dictation feature allows veterinarians to dictate notes hands-free, dramatically reducing the time spent on after-hours charting. This not only improves work-life balance but also ensures that records are more detailed and completed in a timely manner.\n\nThe integration of AI into practice management is not about replacing the expertise of veterinary professionals. It\'s about augmenting it. By handling repetitive tasks, analyzing complex data, and providing intelligent insights, AI frees up veterinarians to do what they do best: practice medicine and care for animals. The future of veterinary care is a partnership between human expertise and artificial intelligence, and that future is already here with StringSoft.\n',filename:"ai-in-veterinary-medicine"},{content:'---\ntitle: "Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine"\nslug: "digital-imaging-and-communications-in-medicine"\nexcerpt: "Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the international standard for medical images and related information, defining the formats for medical images so they have the data and qu…"\ncategory: "Technology"\ndate: "2022-09-26"\nimage: "https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Keep-Your-Processes-Organized-In-a-Process-Library-300x134.jpg"\nimageDescription: "Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine"\n---\nDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the international standard for medical images and related information, defining the formats for medical images so they have the data and quality necessary to be exchanged in a clinical setting. DICOM has become indispensable in the veterinary industry, and the system offers numerous advantages. Keep reading to learn about this complex system and how your practice can benefit.\n\n### DICOM history\nIn the 1980s, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) made it clear that computing would play an increasingly important role in the medical industry. At the time, the manufacturers of these technologies were the only ones who could easily decode and print the images produced. DICOM history highlights include:\n\n- **1983** —\n\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) form a standards committee to address the problem facing radiologists, physicians, and equipment vendors.\n- **1985** — ACR-NEMA 300 is released, specifying image transmission and covering point-to-point image communication.\n- **1993** — The third version of the standard is released. This version uses local area networks by layering the medical image protocols on top of general networking protocols. The name is changed to DICOM.\n- **1995** — The DICOM standards committee is reorganized to formally represent all medical specialties using imaging.\n- **2000** — Internet security mechanisms are added through secure communication profiles for the DICOM protocol.\n- **Early 2000s** — Digital radiography becomes mainstream for veterinarians.\n- **2003** — Multi-frame enhanced image formats are adopted to support the next generation of advanced imaging technologies.\n- **2006** — The DICOM standards committee releases a supplementary addendum to address the special needs in veterinary medicine and veterinary diagnostic imaging.\n- **2016** — Small animal acquisition context is added.\n\n### DICOM applications\nDICOM is the standard communications protocol for capturing, storing, and transferring medical images and related data. The term refers to the protocol, as well as the corresponding file format. Specific applications include:\n\n- **Data format** — DICOM organizes information into data sets so that an image contains the patient identification in the file, preventing the image from being separated from this information by mistake.\n- **Image display** — The DICOM committee developed a grayscale standard display function. This was necessary to ensure grayscale image displays were identical on different monitors and hard copy images were consistent when printed from various printers.\n- **Modality worklist** — The DICOM modality worklist service describes imaging procedures that have been scheduled for operation by an image acquisition device. The items on the work list include details about the patient (e.g., name, sex, age), the procedure scheduled, equipment type, the reason for the exam, and the veterinarian ordering the exam. This information is used by the imaging device to populate details in the image metadata. Before this technology, the scanner operator had to enter the information manually.\n- **Storage** — The DICOM store service allows users to send images to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) or workstation. The DICOM storage commitment service allows users to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device. This may be on a redundant disk or on backup media.\n- **Retrieve** — DICOM users can use a workstation to find image lists and retrieve them from a PAC.\n- **Print** — The DICOM print service is used to send images to a DICOM printer and ensures consistency among various display devices, including hard copy printouts.\n\n### DICOM benefits for veterinarians\n![a dog getting a medical check up from a vet](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/DICOM-benefits-for-veterinarians.jpg)\n\nMedical imaging modalities are an essential tool to properly diagnose patients without using more invasive techniques, and DICOM has become ubiquitous wherever medical imaging is used. Benefits for veterinarians include:\n\n- **Better diagnosis and patient care** — When veterinarians have the ability to send medical data and ask for advice from a consulting veterinary expert, they can provide more accurate diagnoses and better patient care.\n- **Improved workflow** — DICOM eliminates the need to struggle with manual filing. Veterinarians can quickly retrieve and access images remotely, saving time and energy.\n- **Easier access** — DICOM provides a more organized and convenient management system for patient information. All data can be accessed through a single workstation since images are integrated into the hospital’s database.\n- **Improved communication** — DICOM allows images and structured reports to easily be sent to referring veterinarians, improving communication so everyone knows the patient’s condition.\n- **No need for physical storage** — Images are securely stored digitally, eliminating the need for bulky physical storage files.\n\nFinding a company that complies with DICOM is essential to provide optimal patient care and ensure you meet the standards set by the American College of Veterinary Radiologists (ACVR) for PACS.

Use technology to automate appointment reminders and follow-ups. Encourage feedback and be responsive to client concerns to build strong relationships.\n\n#### 9. **Managing Stress and Work-Life Balance**\n\nStarting a new veterinary practice can be incredibly demanding, often leading to long hours and significant stress. Balancing the demands of your new business with personal well-being is essential for long-term success.\\n\\n**Solution:**\n\nPrioritize self-care and set boundaries to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Delegate tasks and responsibilities to your team to avoid burnout. Consider joining a support group or networking with other veterinary professionals to share experiences and advice.\n\n## Conclusion\nOpening a new veterinary practice comes with numerous challenges, but with careful planning and strategic execution, these obstacles can be overcome.

Proper communication with your team members, clients, and referral veterinarians is crucial to ensure your pet patients receive the care they need and deserve. Veterinary practice management software (PMS) enables you to easily communicate with everyone involved in a case to ensure all necessary information is available, so you can provide the best possible care for your patients. StringSoft PMS can enhance your practice’s communication in many ways.\n\n#### 1. Improving Communication Among Veterinary Team Members\nOn a busy day when several appointments are scheduled, every team member must work together and communicate effectively to efficiently provide exceptional care for every patient. Fully electronic medical records facilitate productive communication by ensuring all patient information is quickly accessible and available, and that all important documents, such as client information, patient history, current vitals, laboratory results, and diagnostic images, can be conveniently retrieved with a few simple keystrokes. Additionally, all veterinary team members can easily view the day’s appointments and know what to expect. Valuable veterinary PMS features include:\n\n- **Automated SOAP entries** — Each veterinary team member associated with a case can make an individually coded SOAP entry, allowing everyone on the case to fully understand the patient’s current status. If a team member has a question about an entry, they know exactly who to seek out. In addition, the entries automatically attach charges and schedule treatments, so charges are not missed, and treatments are administered on time.\n- **Laboratory interfaces** — Veterinary PMS allows interface creation to in-house equipment, reference labs, and lab information systems, so team members can easily access their patient’s lab results.\n- **Smart imaging** — Images can be imported from scans, cameras, disks, and picture archiving and communication system (PACS) servers, so all team members can conveniently view their patient’s diagnostic images.\n- **Appointment scheduling** — The day’s schedule can be viewed in a grid or an Outlook style view, so veterinary team members can plan their day.\n\n#### 2. Improving Communication Between Veterinarians and Pet Owners\nA recent Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI) study demonstrated that most pet owners consider their pet an important part of their family. These bonded pet owners expect high-quality care from their veterinarian, starting with good communication. Effective communication with clients increases after-care compliance, enhances pet owner satisfaction, and can improve better pet health outcomes. Veterinary PMS facilitates client communication in several ways, including:\n\n- **Texting** — Messages can be texted to the client through the PMS, and the owner’s response will appear on the communications screen.\n- **Appointment reminders** — Veterinary PMS automates client appointment reminders, and the client can confirm, change, or cancel the appointment via text message.\n- **Client portal** — A convenient client portal allows pet owners to log in to view future appointments, request appointments, refill prescriptions, and view and make payments.\n\nIn addition, when a client sends a message to the veterinarian, their message will appear on the communications screen with an alert that the veterinarian has a new communication. Multiple communication routes will help your clients feel informed about their pet’s care, and ensure they can notify you if their pet experiences a complication. This connection fosters satisfaction and loyalty, and improves patient care.\n\n#### 3. Improving Communication Between Referring and Receiving Veterinarians\n\n![a doctor holding a tablet with a network of people on it](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Improving-communication-between-referring-and-receiving-veterinarians.jpg)\n\nWhen a pet is referred for further diagnostics or an advanced procedure, effective communication is crucial. The receiving veterinarian must know what the case entails, and the referring veterinarian needs to understand what follow-up care is needed. The veterinary PMS referral portal facilitates easy communication between both parties. Valuable features include:\n\n- **Electronic submission** — Referring veterinarians can send referral letters electronically, creating a submitted case. Once the client makes an appointment or checks in, the submitted case is attached to the pet’s medical record. Additional information, including lab work, diagnostic images, and other relevant documents, can also be electronically submitted through the referral portal.\n- **Remote access** — The referring veterinarian can remotely access his or her patient’s case for status updates, depending on what information is made accessible for each referring veterinarian.\n- **Bidirectional communication** — The referral portal allows messages to be sent between referring and receiving veterinarians to ensure everyone has the necessary information about each case. Good veterinary care begins with good communication, and veterinary PMS facilitates communication with everyone involved in a pet’s care. Every practice can benefit from improved communication, so contact **StringSoft** for a complimentary consultation and demonstration.\n',filename:"3-ways-veterinary-practice-management-software-improves-communication"},{content:'---\ntitle: "8 Ways Veterinary Practice Management Software Benefits Your Specialty Workflows"\nslug: "8-ways-veterinary-practice-management-software-benefits-your-specialty-workflows"\nexcerpt: "Veterinary specialists need an intuitive, hassle-free interface that provides user-friendly workflows so they can organize and perform tasks quickly, and help their specialty practice run smoothly …"\ncategory: "Technology"\ndate: "2022-08-10"\nimage: "https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Customer-support-is-readily-available.jpg"\nimageDescription: "8 Ways Veterinary Practice Management Software Benefits Your Specialty Workflows"\n---\nVeterinary specialists need an intuitive, hassle-free interface that provides user-friendly workflows so they can organize and perform tasks quickly, and help their specialty practice run smoothly and efficiently. We designed StringSoft veterinary practice management software with the specific efficiency issues of specialty practices in mind. Here are eight ways user-friendly software can benefit your specialty workflows.\n\n#### 1. Veterinary Professionals Can Work From One Screen\n\nVeterinary specialty practices are often busy and hectic, and needing to check multiple locations to find patient information can eat up valuable time. Fully electronic medical records allow patient information to be entered directly into the system, so tracking down X-ray folders, lab results, and other important documents is a problem of the past. Everything is at the team\'s fingertips, and they can easily view a patient\'s medical record, add treatments, place lab orders, and order specialty procedures all from one screen.\n\n#### 2. Common Veterinary Tasks Can Be Automated\n\n**StringSoft** automates repetitive and tedious tasks, saving team members more time.\n\nInstead of busy veterinarians repeatedly typing the same procedure notes over and over, automated SOAP entries allow SOAPs, diagnoses, treatments, charges, lab work, and vitals to be predefined, and allow common tasks to be performed with a single click. Benefits include:\n\n- **Charges are attached** — Charges for each service no longer have to be manually entered, because charges are automatically attached as data is inputted.\n- **Treatments are booked** — Relevant treatments are automatically scheduled based on the information entered.\n- **Reminders are scheduled** — Call back reminders are automatically scheduled.\n- **Client reports are generated** — The data automatically generates a client report.\n\n#### 3. Veterinarians Updating Medical Records Can Be Flexible\n\nAccurate veterinary medical records are critical to ensure each patient receives the best possible care. **StringSoft** allows veterinary professionals to conveniently update the patient\'s files with these methods:\n\n- **SOAPs** — Each team member associated with the case can enter their individual coded and time-stamped SOAP entry. For example, internal medicine, radiology, and surgery team members can each add their own notes to the medical record to ensure it is complete, and includes all pertinent details. Preformulated templates are also available.\n- **Data entry** — Any data type can be created and used to track information (e.g., vitals, patient weight, and tumor size). Data entry can be user-defined for any result, including positive or negative results, numeric values, or text. The high, low, and default value for each result can be specified to simplify the process.\n\n#### 4. Laboratory Interfaces Can Be Created for Veterinary Equipment\n\nBy connecting a workstation to hospital laboratory equipment or configuring remote connections to online services, lab work orders, results, and reports are easily added to a patient\'s medical record. Lab charges can also be automatically attached, so missed charges for these services will no longer affect your bottom line. Equipment supported includes:\n\n- **In-house equipment** — Abaxis, Heska\n- **Reference laboratories** — Antech, IDEXX\n- **Laboratory information systems** — Orchard Harvest, Orchard Copia, Labdaq, Sapphire, Visual Lab, VADDS, and StringSoft\'s own system\n\n#### 5. Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging Has Many Options\n\nAdding diagnostic images to your patient\'s medical record is simple, as is adjusting or notating the image for easier viewing or understanding. Benefits user-friendly PMS can provide include:\n\n- **Importing images** — The Smart Imaging feature allows images to be imported from scans, cameras, disk, and picture archiving and communication system (PACS) servers.\n- **Annotating images** — Text, handwriting, drawings, or predefined shapes, such as arrows, boxes, and circles, can be used to explain or highlight areas in diagnostic images.\n- **Manipulating images** — Images can be manipulated for better viewing by rotating, panning, zooming, reversing and adjusting the contrast, and adjusting the saturation, hue, and brightness.\n- **Storing images** — Diagnostic images are stored in their original format, and a separate layer is stored if the image is annotated. The images can be emailed, printed, or copied and pasted into patient reports with ease.\n\n#### 6. Veterinary Appointment Scheduling Is Simplified\n\n**StringSoft** workflow dashboards are available for a vast variety of specialties including radiology, cardiology, surgery, anesthesia, behavior, chemotherapy, dermatology, dentistry, emergency, holistic, internal medicine, laboratory, microbiology, neurology, nutrition, oncology, ophthalmology, pharmacology, preventive, rehabilitation, theriogenology, toxicology, and welfare.\n\nIn addition, individual veterinary fields, including avian, beef cattle, dairy, equine, exotics, food animal, poultry, reptile, swine, and zoological, can be specified. Different scheduling views offer different benefits depending on the team\'s needs and include:\n\n- **Grid view** — The grid view is helpful for large practices that need to more efficiently sort and filter their available and booked appointments.\n- **Outlook style view** — This view allows the practice appointment schedule to synchronize with mail service providers (e.g., Microsoft Outlook).\n\n#### 7. Veterinary Practice Productivity Is Increased\n\nYour veterinary PMS can handle many managerial issues and repetitive tasks, allowing team members to spend more time treating patients and attending to clients. In addition, patient medical information is always at their fingertips, and tediously leafing through paper files is no longer necessary.\n\n#### 8. Customer Support Is Readily Available\n\n![a person touching a button with a smiley face drawn on it](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Customer-support-is-readily-available.jpg)\n\nMonthly system updates ensure that your **StringSoft** PMS always provides the most advanced technology, and they are often based on requests for new features that clients consider valuable to improve practice workflows.\n\nAdditionally, customer service agents are always available by phone to help with any problems, and to address your concerns promptly, ensuring your patients and clients are attended to as soon as possible. The right veterinary PMS can improve workflows for general, specialty, and corporate practices, and veterinarians in a university setting.

Ensure your veterinary practice team's focus remains on clients and their pets by relying on well-designed practice management software that can automate many time-eating—but necessary—tasks. To learn how you and your team can complete each workday's necessary—but mundane—administrative tasks, read our **StringSoft** software team's practice management software guide, and boost your veterinary practice's efficiency.\n\n#### 1. Automate and Link Veterinary Practice Administrative Tasks\n\nWhen you entered the veterinary field, you likely expected to spend most of your day caring for patients rather than staring at a computer screen. Fortunately, current practice management software has streamlined and automated many veterinary practice administrative tasks such as entering medical record information, generating invoices, and searching for laboratory results. Ideally, your software should be your practice's workhorse, automating many mundane tasks that bog down your team. Through a single click, innovative technology can attach treatments and charges to SOAP entries, create automatic client callbacks, and generate reminders. This automated linking saves your team time, and offers improved patient and client care by ensuring no information falls through the cracks.\n\n#### 2. Allow Clients to Access Their Own Pet-Care Requests\n\nIf your practice management software does not provide a client portal, your veterinary practice—and your clients—are missing out. Millennials likely comprise a growing portion of your client demographic, and they expect to play a major role in their pet's care, using technology to do so. Making their pets' medical information easily accessible will strengthen your bond, and increase your millennial clients' loyalty, while taking a huge load off your team's plate. Through a client portal, pet owners can:\n\n- View past and upcoming appointments\n- Schedule visits\n- View vaccination and health service reminders\n- Request prescription refills\n- Pay outstanding invoices\n- Electronically sign treatment plans and make a deposit toward services\n- Communicate with a veterinary team member\n\nAfter your veterinary practice introduces a client portal, your team will see a reduction in phone calls. As you and your team direct an increasing number of clients to the portal, and they begin to understand the technology's numerous benefits, your clients will complete many of the time-consuming administrative tasks your team currently manages.\n\n#### 3. Create Protocols in Your Veterinary Practice Management Software\n\nAn efficient team anticipates each other's needs—making necessary supplies available, delivering treatment plans, and obtaining client permission—all before the veterinarian completes their exam room consultation. When effective practice protocols are in place, veterinarians no longer have to spend lengthy periods dictating to the support team about each patient's test, treatment, and medication. To ensure your team's maximum efficiency and consistency, provide staff with written medical protocol guidelines for commonly performed procedures. After creating common protocol templates, categorize line items in your practice management software to ensure all related services, medications, and supplies are always included. These groupings that automatically populate from your medical record notes or treatment plan templates will improve fee capture, and minimize human error when you and your team are strapped for time.\n\n#### 4. Integrate With Outside Veterinary Applications\n\nYour time is best spent caring for patients and communicating with clients. So, stop wasting this precious resource by chasing down laboratory reports and diagnostic images, and ensure your practice management software integrates with your diagnostic tools. Laboratory results and images should automatically load to each patient's medical record, allowing you to review every aspect of a pet's health history at once. In addition, your practice management software should integrate with outside applications such as those which provide telemedicine services. Clients appreciate the ability to communicate with their veterinarians without having to drive to the practice, and telemedicine capability enables you to care for more patients in less time.\n\n#### 5. Automate Veterinary Data Backup and Software Updates\n\n![A person typing on a laptop keyboard](https://www.stringsoft.com/blog/Automate-veterinary-data-backup-and-software-updates.jpg)\n\nIf your team's end-of-day tasks include backing up data and waiting around for a software update, you are wasting their time and your money. Current practice management software automates these critical tasks—with no effort on your team's part and no veterinary practice downtime. Current veterinary practice management software automates many mundane administrative processes, enabling your team to perform tasks only they are trained to complete. By upgrading your software, you give your team the opportunity to focus on the work they value—patient and client care.
